a little proof of life app that barely scratches the surface of my idea and i want to spend much more time on it implementing new features and improving the code quality.

Many many feature stretch goals, including nuanced prompts, Sections for plot and character development. Integrating image prompts. API integration particularly around Cognitive Services and other APIs that would be extremly interesting and useful. Users with authorization and community aspect. And more. The sky's the limit.

Code goals, break the project out into reusable components. Went with a monolith file pattern for the sake of time so i could maximize time spent on the actual project. Felt comfortable about the monolith pattern because of TypeScript support and my really nice VS code features that made it manageable. Need to improve my git workflow as it for sure took a back seat to just simply focusing on coding some of my ideas.
